## Requirements

* GoCD server version `v19.3.0` or above
* Docker Server

## Installation

* Copy the file `build/libs/docker-elastic-agents-VERSION.jar` to the GoCD server under `${GO_SERVER_DIR}/plugins/external`
and restart the server.
* The `GO_SERVER_DIR` is usually `/var/lib/go-server` on **Linux** and `C:\Program Files\Go Server` on **Windows**.

## Configuration

### Configure a Cluster Profile

The cluster profile settings are used to provide cluster level configurations for the plugin. Configurations such as docker server configuration and private registry settings are provided in cluster profile settings.

1. Login to `GoCD server` as admin and navigate to **_Admin_** _>_ **_Elastic Profile_**

    ![Elastic Profiles][1]

2. Click on **_Add Cluster Profile_**. Select `Docker Elastic Agent Plugin` from the plugin ID dropdown.

If you don't want those values to show up, please explicitly clear them out in the configuration form before switching to use a docker configuration file |

### Create an elastic profile

    The Elastic Agent Profile is used to define the configuration of a docker container(GoCD docker agent). The profile is used to configure the docker image, set memory limits, provide docker command and environment variables etc...

1. Login to `GoCD server` as admin and navigate to **_Admin_** _>_ **_Elastic Profiles_**

    ![Elastic Profiles][3]

2. Click on **_New Elastic Agent Profile_** to create new elastic agent profile for a cluster.

### Connecting to a remote docker daemon secured with TLS

If you would like to run elastic agents on a separate machine from GoCD server, you can configure the agent machine to allow remote access to its docker daemon socket, following the [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/remote-access/).

You must make sure that the IP and exposed port of the docker daemon is accessible from GoCD server (ie. any firewall/security group rules are configured correctly to allow incoming traffic from GoCD server to the docker daemon socket). You can test network connectivity from your GoCD server with a tool like netcat, eg.: `nc -vz <docker-daemon-machine-IP-or-hostname> 2375`.

It is recommended that a docker daemon socket exposed remotely be secured with TLS. You may follow the steps in the [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/protect-access/#use-tls-https-to-protect-the-docker-daemon-socket) for generating the required CA, server, and client cert and keys. The CA cert, server cert and key, and `--tlsverify` flag must be passed to the docker daemon on start-up, while the CA and client cert and key must be added to your cluster profile configuration under **Docker CA Certificate**, **Docker Client cert** and **Docker Client key**. These will be used by GoCD server to carry out a TLS handshake with the remote docker daemon. If any of these values are incorrectly configured, you will see TLS/SSL handshake errors in your GoCD server logs.
